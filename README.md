# Pollution-Air-Quality
In my 2nd year of University, I was paired up with four other talented team members to uncover the secrets of the pollution in our air. Though we didn't win a nobel prize just yet, I would say the experience and the overall knowledge is plenty.

As the world was getting unhealthy, we decided to talk of climate change, and as a society, we needed change. We need to find out what's in our air that's causing a rise to concern for that to happen. To fully grasp the impending doom we might be in; we decided to get a dataset encompassing our air quality throughout the past 50 years and see if there were any conclusions we can draw from our modern world to the ones people experienced in the past. The data and models we found were surprising and said a lot about our habits and pollution levels. The most notable thing we shared was our air quality index or AQI, which represented how clean our air was getting exponentially worse in the 2000s.
